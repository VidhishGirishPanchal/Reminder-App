# Reminder-App
A Reminder app made using EJS, CSS and the backend is made using NodeJS and ExpressJS. And the database is maintained by using MongoDB and MongooseJS.
Different webpages can be made like setting reminder tasks for home, work, office and whichever place the user wishes to add tasks in, 
this has been made possible using express routers.
This app is useful for everyone to make a list of tasks to be done at different places and keep a track of the tasks done and the tasks that are yet to be completed.
